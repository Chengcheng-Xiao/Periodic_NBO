     !I previously calculated the AO_PW overlap for all basis function in the top loop,
     !this was then passed to the bottom loop, where matrix multiplication was to treat all AOs at the same time.
     !This was faster, but had huge memore requirements.
     !That array also had a k-point dimension, for parallelization, which only made things worse
     !Switching to one AO function at a time treated via matrix-vector multiplication is a bit slower but requires an order of magnitude lower memory requirements.
     !
     !I think a happy middle ground could be reached by treating blocks of AO's using matrix mulitplication
     !The blocks could be the number of bands, so that only the amount of memory used for the plane wave coefficients would be needed.
     !Then a few large matrix multiplications would be needed, instead of the many vector-matrix multiplications I am currently doing.
