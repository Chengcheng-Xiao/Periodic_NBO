!This subroutine calculates the inverse overlap matrices at each k-point used in the planewave calculation
!The first step is to calculate the real space overlap over a sufficient number of unit cells 
!Linear combinations of these real space overlaps (Bloch transforms) then yield the k-space overlap
!LAPACK subroutines are then used to calculate the inverse overlap matrices, which are required for the projection

!The process for calculating the Bloch-space matrices comes from and uses the notation of:
